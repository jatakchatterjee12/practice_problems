  If you are not familier with how to declare a custom comparator function then you can have a read over this stackoverflow thread.
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16111337/declaring-a-priority-queue-in-c-with-a-custom-comparator/48587737

  Basically, you can do it in many ways out of which i feel the doing it with the class is the simpler. We can also do it with 
  lambda function but for that we would have to make some more arrangements which declaring our pioirity queue.

  Type 1:
  auto myComparator = [](const psi &p1 const psi &p2){
    if(p1.first == p2.first) return p1.second < p2.second;

    return p1.first > p2.first;
  } 

  While declaring the priority queue
  priority_queue<psi, vector<psi>, decltype(myComparator)> anyName(myComparator)

  Type 2: If you want to declare a normal function and use it in the priority queue then it can be done in the following way
  bool myComparator(const psi &p2 const psi *p2) {
    if(p1.first == p2.first) return p1.second < p2.second;

    return p1.first > p2.first;
  }

  While declaring the priority queue you just have to give the pointer to the function
  priority_queue<psi, vector<psi>, decltype(&myComparator)> anyName(myComparator)
 */
class myComparator {
  public:
    bool operator() (const psi &p1, const psi &p2) {
      if(p1.first == p2.first) return p1.second < p2.second;
      
      return p1.first > p2.first;
    }

    /* Here the point to note is how we are writing the compare function. 
      We will return true for what type of order we want to maintain. The order will be seen from bottom to top.
      Actually there are many ways to understand but after seeing lot of ways i found the below one more understandable and easier.
      
      We will see the ordering from bottom to top. So, if i say that the order is ascending then it means that the smaller elements 
      will be at the bottom and the higher elements will be at the top. (I'm taking tree representation of the heap, 
	  if you consider array representation then the higher values will be at right and lower at the left)

      Here if you are getting the doubt that - here the higher values are coming at the top and lower values are coming at the 
      bottom then it is max heap not min heap. Then please note that the priority queue that we have declared in the getTopKFreqStrings 
      is neither min heap nor max heap. 
      The working or the order in which the elements are stored in priority queue depends on the comparator function.

      General syntax to declare the priority queue is priority_queue<data_type, container, comparator>
      the default values for container is vector<data_type> and for comparator is less<data_type>. 
      It automatically take the datatype what to give.

      In case of max heap, we declare it as => priority_queue<int> maxHeap;
      Its basically a shorthand of this => priority_queue<int, vector<int>, less<int>> maxHeap; 
      we don't write the defualt values

      and in case of min heap we declare it as => priority_queue<int, vector<int> greater<int>> minHeap;

      note the comparator in both, its because of them the priority queue becomes min heap or max heap otherwise 
      from the name itself we can see (priority) so - to which elements we should give priority depends on the comparator function. 
      So, now lets come back to question

      So, as per the question we want the decreasing order for the frequency of the strings
      and increasing order in the lexiographical way
      so that the strings with the least frequency and cannot be fitted inside k can be poped.

      So, p1.first > p2.first will return true only when the frequency of first string is more than the second
      similary, p1.second < p2.second will return true when the string s1 in p1 is lexiographically smaller then string s2 in p2.
